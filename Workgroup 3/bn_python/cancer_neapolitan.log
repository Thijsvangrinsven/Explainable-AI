    Marrying B and C


Triangulating prime component with 2 members:
    E, C
This component is a clique of cost 4

Triangulating prime component with 3 members:
    C, D, B
This component is a clique of cost 8

Triangulating prime component with 3 members:
    C, B, A
This component is a clique of cost 8


Total cost of triangulation for all prime components is 20


Cliques:

Clique 3, 2 members, table size = 4:
    C, E

Clique 2, 3 members, table size = 8:
    C, B, A

Clique 1, 3 members, table size = 8:
    C, B, D

Total clique table size: 20


The junction forest:

Creating junction tree with clique 3 as root ...

Cliques 2 and 3 linked, separator has 1 member and table size = 2:
    C

Cliques 1 and 2 linked, separator has 2 members and table size = 4:
    C, B


Assignment of potentials to cliques:

    Node E assigned to clique 3
    Node C assigned to clique 2
    Node D assigned to clique 1
    Node B assigned to clique 2
    Node A assigned to clique 2


Checking conditional probability potentials:
